## Overview
The Product Recommendation Chatbot is a sophisticated system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide users with personalized product recommendations. By integrating a Graph Database, the chatbot can efficiently retrieve relevant product data and enhance the recommendation process with contextual understanding.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailors product suggestions based on user preferences and history.
- **Graph Database Integration**: Utilizes a graph database to manage and query product relationships.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval-based and generative models for accurate and context-aware recommendations.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: User-friendly interface for engaging with the chatbot.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: Designed to handle large datasets and concurrent user interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j or similar for managing product relationships.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For understanding and generating human-like responses.
- **Machine Learning**: Models for recommendation and language generation.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deploying the chatbot interface.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.

## Architecture
The system architecture includes the following components:
1. **Frontend**: User interface for interacting with the chatbot.
2. **Backend**: Flask application handling requests and responses.
3. **Graph Database**: Stores and queries product data.
4. **RAG Model**: Combines retrieval and generation mechanisms for recommendations.
5. **NLP Engine**: Processes user input and generates responses.
